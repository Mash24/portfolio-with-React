# 🚀 Jackson Mwakano's Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my digital home — a modern, interactive, and fully responsive **portfolio web app** designed to showcase not only what I build but **why and how I build it**. I'm Jackson Mwakano, a self-driven **Cloud Engineer** and **Frontend Developer**, currently transitioning from web development to the world of cloud-native solutions.
